# working-with-supercollider
This repo will collect various useful resources for working with Supercollider. The collection will likely be somewhat idiosyncratic as it reflects what I find most useful for working with Supercollider to create interesting music. I have chosen to create and publish this repo publicly on the assumption that it may be of use to others.
